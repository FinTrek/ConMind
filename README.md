# Consumer Mindset

ConMind is a market segmentation tool for retail businesses that uses machine learning techniques on clickstream data to segregate online consumers as 'goal oriented' versus 'experiential' shoppers. It allows businesses to create adaptive web design tailored to increase shopper retention and reduce cart abandonment.  

Goal-oriented shoppers desire to purchase what they want quickly and without distraction, whereas experiential customers tend to spend more time, browse a larger variety of items, and enjoy a foraging attitude to shopping. 

Traditional market segmentation tools rely on demographic or geographic differences, rather than differentiating consumers on their traansient behavioural shopping attitudes. This tool identifies and provides an actionable opportunity for retailers to better personalize their web interface based on the consumer's transient shopping behaviour and preferences. 

# Prerequisites and Data aquisition

The raw data used for this analysis is semi-proprietary but a sample of the attributes available has been made available in the file Sample_data.ipynb. Please get in touch with me (lavisha.jindal@gmail.com) for directions on how to obtain the entire dataset.

# Getting started

The notebooks folder contains python notebooks on the preliminary analysis. 

# Acknowledgement
